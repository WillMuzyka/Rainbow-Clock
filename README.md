# Rainbow-Clock
A rainbow clock developed using Processing and Javascript, based on the Coding Train Youtube Channel.

This clock has as objective to show the hour, minutes and seconds using little balls (dots) that move away from the mouse pointer.
It also disperses the balls every time the number changes. The color of the balls can be changed with a slider.
